# Cyclistic Case study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
### Author: Thaddeus Aguirre

## Introduction
I am completing my first Case Study to earn the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate using the 6 steps of data analysis (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act).

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Characters and teams
**Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also oﬀering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

**Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

**Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how I, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

**Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders. Although the pricing ﬂexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diﬀer, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aﬀect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Business Task
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data Source
I used data from February 2022 through January 2023 for my analysis.
The data has been made available by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC with [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Conclusion
Based on my analysis the busiest months for casual riders and subscribed riders is the summer months. Also, on average the weekends are the busiest days throughout the year.

## Key Recommendations
1. Increase rates for casual riders during peak seasons and weekends.
2. Offer 3, 6, and 12 month subscriptions
3. Create promotional marketing campaign to encourage subscribers during slow seasons.

## Tools
R Studio for data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization.
